# Automated-Youtube-Video-Slide-Conversion-Tool
This project is a simple Python tool that downloads YouTube videos using yt-dlp and extracts slides by saving frames at regular intervals with OpenCV. It saves these extracted images into a folder, making it easy to capture important slides from lectures, presentations, or any other video content.
